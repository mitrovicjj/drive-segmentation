# Retinal Vessel Segmentation on the DRIVE Dataset

This project explores two deep learning models for **semantic segmentation** of blood vessels in retinal images, utilizing few-shot fine-tuning techniques:

- **UNet** (Convolutional Neural Network)
- **SegFormer** (Transformer-based architecture)

The goal is to segment vessels from retinal images using the **DRIVE** dataset, which contains 20 training images and 20 testing images.

## Models & Experiments

- Both models are trained and evaluated on the same dataset.
- Metrics like accuracy and loss are plotted and compared.
- Example predictions are visualized below.
